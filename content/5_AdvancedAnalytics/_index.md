## Introduction to Sagemaker Extension

With the use case of _Predictions for Credit Application Risks_ we want to introduce you _Machine Learning_ with the _AWS Sagemaker Autopilot_
service, where we show how to develop and utilize an end-to-end machine learning project on data stored in Exasol using the AWS SageMaker Autopilot service as 
the backend for Machine Learning.


### AWS Sagemaker Autopilot Service

AWS SageMaker is an AWS public cloud service in which users can build and deploy machine learning models. SageMaker provides a number of levels of abstraction to users while developing machine learning models. At one of its highest level of abstraction, SageMaker enables users to use an Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) service, called Autopilot in AWS, that automatizes the process of applying machine learning to real world problems.

Autopilot covers a complete pipeline of developing an end-to end machine learning project, from raw data to a deployable model. It is able to automatically build, train and tune a number of machine learning models by inspecting your data set. In this way, the following tasks, which are repeatedly applied by ML-experts in machine learning projects, are automated:


- Pre-process and clean the data
- Perform feature engineering and select the most appropriate ones
- Determine the most appropriate ML algorithm
- Tune and optimize hyper-parameters of model
- Post-process machine learning models

The Exasol Sagemaker Extension takes these advantages of AWS Autopilot and enables users to easily create effective and efficient machine learning models without expert knowledge.

### Exasol SageMaker Extension

The Exasol Sagemaker Extension provides a Python library together with Exasol Scripts and UDFs that train Machine Learning Models on data stored in Exasol using AWS SageMaker Autopilot service.

The extension basically exports a given Exasol table into AWS S3, and then triggers Machine Learning training using the AWS Autopilot service with the specified parameters. In addition, the training status can be polled using the auxiliary scripts provided within the scope of the project. In order to perform prediction on a trained Autopilot model, one of the methods is to deploy the model to the real-time AWS endpoint. This extension provides Lua scripts for creating/deleting real-time endpoint and creates a model-specific UDF script for making real-time predictions. The following figure indicates the overview of this solution.

### Prerequisites for this Module
	
In case of enabled Multi-Factor-Authentication for your user please mind the following article from AWS:

	https://github.com/exasol/sagemaker-extension/issues/90
	

In AWS **I**dentiy and **A**ccess **M**anagemnt (IAM) create a role named

	sagemaker-role
	
and add two policies to add, firstly:

	{
	    "Version": "2012-10-17",
	    "Statement": [
	        {
	            "Effect": "Allow",
	            "Action": [
	                "s3:*"
	            ],
	            "Resource": "*"
	        },
	        {
	            "Effect": "Allow",
	            "Action": [
	                "iam:CreatePolicy",
	                "iam:CreateRole",
	                "iam:AttachRolePolicy",
	                "iam:DeleteRole",
	                "iam:DeletePolicy",
	                "iam:DetachRolePolicy"
	            ],
	            "Resource": "*"
	        }
	    ]
	}
	
and name it sagemaker-s3-access. For the second policy for this role search for and select

	AmazonSageMakerFullAccess
	
	
Finally attach the policies to the sagemaker-role with the _aws_ tool on the Deployment Server:

	aws iam attach-role-policy --role-name sagemaker-role --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::166283903643:policy/sagemaker-s3-access
	aws iam attach-role-policy --role-name sagemaker-role --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonSageMakerFullAccess
	
		
{{% notice warning %}}	
The following workaround should be only utilized in case of an unresovable behaviour, e.g. a security error when starting the
training job (later in this tutorial)
{{% /notice %}}

Create new user account named _Sagemaker Account_ and create for this account the neccessary AWS Access Key. Attach the following
policy directly to this user account.

	{
	    "Version": "2012-10-17",
	    "Statement": [
	        {
	            "Effect": "Allow",
	            "Action": "*",
	            "Resource": "*"
	        }
	    ]
	}
	
Be careful with this role as it non-restricive to AWS services - use it with the <b>outmost</b> care. However, you need to create the sagemaker 
role as it is required later on...
